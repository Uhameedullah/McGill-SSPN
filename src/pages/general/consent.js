            Just because someone consents to one thing DOES NOT mean they
            consent to others

            You are entitled to feel safe and have your boundaries respected

        <h2>What is an active bystander?</h2>
        <p>
          While you rush to collect your coins this week, it's important to take
          a second and check up on your friends and fellow players to ensure a
          fun and safe time for everyone. A bystander is anyone who is a witness
          to an event or situation, but is not the person it is directed
          towards. A passive bystander chooses not to interrupt or intervene to
          make a difference.{" "}
          <i>
            An active bystander takes the initiative to help in situations of
            concern and makes a positive difference before, during, or after the
            event or situation takes place.
          </i>
          <br />
          <b>Steps to intervening:</b>
          <ol>
            <li>Noticing</li>
            <li>Interpreting a situation </li>
            <li>
              Assuming responsibility. Remember the 4 D’s. Choose which form of
              intervention you feel comfortable and safe with:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <b>(Be) Direct:</b> approach the situation directly, i.e. go
                  up to them and ask “how’s it going?”
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Delegate:</b> find another person to intervene on your
                  behalf, i.e. ask their riend, a server, a Coordinator, etc to
                  check on them
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Distract:</b> anything to break the flow of potential
                  violence, i.e. spilling a drink, start talking to the people
                  involved, ask to go to the bathroom
                </li>
                <li>
                  <b>Do something:</b> when in doubt, do something, even it it’s
                  following up after the event
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Attempt to help consensually</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <b>IDENTITY MATTERS:</b> Certain identities are at higher risk for
            assault/harassment. Your own identity also influences how you may or
            may not intervene.
            <br />
            <b>SAFETY MATTERS:</b> Identifying personal strengths is important
            when considering how to intervene. Your safety is paramount; if you
            think you’ll be at risk, do not intervene.
            <br />
            <b>ONSENT MATTERS:</b> When possible, ask for consent before getting
            involved.
