              A game of skill, cunning, and luck. Nobody really knows where the
              3 men came from, but they brought with them two giant die. Roll
              the dice, check the cheat-sheet, receive beers, pass it on,
              repeat.

                  Determine the 3-Man: the first team to roll a three is the

                  The team to the left of 3-Man goes first, each team following
                  in a clockwise rotation. Each team rolls both dice, acting in
                  accordance with the cheat sheet
                </p>

                <p>
                  If doubles are rolled, the team passes the dice to a team of
                  their choosing. That team will receive x2 as much beer as the
                  total of their roll.Â All rules are recursiveIf the 3-Man ever
                  rolls a three, they then select a new team to be the 3-Man{" "}
