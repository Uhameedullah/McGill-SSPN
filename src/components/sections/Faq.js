        Gatsbyâ€™s rich data plugin ecosystem lets you build sites with the data
        you want â€” from one or many sources: Pull data from headless CMSs, SaaS
        services, APIs, databases, your file system, and more directly into your
        pages using GraphQL.

        The power hour portion of the night will last, well, an hour. But you
        can stay as long as your heart desires! There will be plenty of time to
        enjoy the dancing and partying that makes Cafe, Cafe.

        Great question! You can come to anyone on Committee at any point during
        the event if you have any questions, comments or concerns. Committee
        members will have distinctive outfits and will very noticeable so come
        chat!

        Power hour events can get quite messy with inadvertent spraying and
        pouring and the like...wear something you donâ€™t care about! Old
        sneakers, worn shirt, maybe even swim googles, whatever. Not the time to
        flex your designer brands ðŸ˜‰.
