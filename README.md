# Summary

Based off of Gastby's Hello World builerplate code, this site is designed to simplify the ticketing process for McGill Events such as Faculty Olympics, Carnival, Science Games and Hype Week. This template is designed to handle waivers, consent videos and the ticketing process itself.

There are four main steps that this project aims to consolidate for attendees: 

1. Ensure all prospective attendees are McGill Students.

2. Ensure prospective attendees are on the captain-provided allow list (optional)

3. Require all prospective attendees watch a consent video in it's entirety (optional)

4. Require all prospective attendees complete a waiver.

5. Assuming all of the above conditions have been met, purchase a ticket via an embedded shopify button. 


## 🚀 Quick start

*TODO: fill this in with how to copy this template and set it up for your event.*

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

```bash
🌳  .
├── 📁  .github
├── 📄  .gitignore
├── 📄  .nvmrc
├── 📄  .prettierignore
├── 📄  .prettierrc
├── 📄  CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

```

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore`**: This is a configuration file and ignore file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`.nvmrc`**: This file defines the expected version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/). NodeJS is a JavaScript runtime.

6.  **`.github`**: This folder contains the issue and pull request templates for github as well as any gith

7.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

8.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

9.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

10. **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

11. **`LICENSE.md`**: This project is licensed under the MIT license.

12. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

13. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

14. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
